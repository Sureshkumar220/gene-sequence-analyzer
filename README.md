# 🧬 Gene Sequence Analyzer with ORF Finder

A bioinformatics web application to analyze DNA sequences and identify potential protein-coding regions (ORFs).

## 🚀 Features
- DNA sequence analysis (length, GC content, nucleotide count)
- Reverse complement generation
- Protein translation
- ORF (Open Reading Frame) detection
- FASTA file upload support

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- Python
- Streamlit
- Biopython

## 📊 Input
- Manual DNA sequence
- FASTA files (.fasta, .fna) from databases like NCBI

## 🧪 Output
- Sequence statistics
- Amino acid translation
- ORF positions and lengths

## ▶️ How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m streamlit run app.py
